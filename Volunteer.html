          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>I evaluated and redesigned the website for COSI's Volunteer and
            Community website to increase visibility of key function and
            optimize its information architecture and aesthetics</p>

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>Prototype, graphic design, usability testing</p>
        </div>

        <!---************* Evaluation *************--->
        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>Website Evaluation</h2>
          <p>Think about this: you are a high school student looking for a
            volunteer position to fill in your service hours. You found COSI
            because it is a famous non-profit museum. You go online and search
            for the volunteer program. Now you are in the page, what next?</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "eval">
          <div class = "img">
            <img src = "resources/images/vol-oldsite.jpg" alt = "product eval">
          </div>
          <div class = "eval-text">
            <p>< My first impression of this page was: too much text!! </p>
            <p>< This is a notice for the unavailability of the youth vol
              position. It is not visible, nor effective </p>
            <p>< The placement of the buttons is very disorganized.
              It intended to use modulations to hide information, but those
              buttons are just so out of place </p>
          </div>
        </div>


        <!---************* organization *************--->
        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>Organization</h2>
          <div class = "organize">
            <p>I first read through the site with a goal to declutter it and
              re-sort information. The content can be categorized as: </p>
          </div>
          <div class = "org-img" id = "org">
            <img src = "resources/images/vol-recategory.png" alt = "recat">
          </div>

          <div class = "organize">
            <p>Then I proposed to 'fold' the information under its respect
              title instead of using buttons. In this way, it makes it more
              intuitive for users to find they want to know.</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "org-img" id = "fold">
            <img src = "resources/images/vol-folding.png" alt = "folding">
          </div>

          <div class = "organize">
            <p>In the old site, "Adult Volunteer" and "Youth Volunteer" were
              mixed in the same page, while they have different processes of
              application and different positions. Therefore, the best way is
              to separate these two programs</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "org-img" id = "twoside">
            <img src = "resources/images/vol-two.png" alt = "two sides" >
          </div>

        </div>

        <!--*******Aesthetics and Discoverbility*****----->
        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>Aesthetics & Discoverability</h2>
          <div class = "organize">
            <p>The whole page was stacked with text, but no any pictures.
              Users would be bored by the lengthy content. </p>
          </div>
          <div class = "org-img" id = "pages">
            <img src = "resources/images/vol-pages.jpg" alt = "pages">
          </div>

        </div>


        <!---************* final thought *************--->
        <div class = "text-section" id ="final">
          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p> During this process, there
            were some tradeoffs I needed to make. Because the main site has
            its own layout, fonts, and color scheme, I had to be consistent with
            the style, aka there was no fancy scrolling or change of navigation.
            A limitation for me was that I wasn't involved in the coding
            process, so the <a href ="https://www.cosi.org/about-cosi/volunteer" target ="blank">
              final website</a> turned out differently from my
            design. To have more control over the substantiation of my design,
            I self-studied HTML & CSS and became a Web Development Intern later. </p>
