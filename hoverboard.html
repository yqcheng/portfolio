        <h1> Hoverboard Redesign</h1>
        <p id = "star">*HCI Course Project </p>

        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>We evaluated the Hoverboard and redesigned it using low-fidelity
            prototypes to improve its safety, effectiveness and feedback. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>Meeting facilitation, graphic design, product evaluation, presentation</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>Achievement</h2>
          <p>We were voted first place in the class competition &#128518</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>Product Evaluation</h2>
          <p>The Hoverboard was a big hit in the market when it first came out.
            Probably because people tend to see that expensive things are quality
            too regarding to Vablen Effect. Regardless of its beautiful
            appearance, my team focused on its weaknesses,
            for which we came up with specific improvement recommendations in
            the next section.</p>

        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <div class = "rec">
            <p class = "improve">Improvement 1 - Safety</p>
            <p>We replace the 2 big wheels with 6 small wheels and the triangle
              structure will make it more stable. Also, we improved the sensor
              and made it move only when it senses two feet.</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "rec-img" id = "one">
            <img src = "resources/images/three-wheels.png" alt = "three wheels">
          </div>

          <div class = "rec">
            <p class = "improve">Improvement 2 - Portability </p>
            <p>We implemented 2 solar panels on the board for more portable
              charging.</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "rec-img" id = "two">
            <img src = "resources/images/solarPanel.png" alt = "solar panel">
          </div>

          <div class = "rec">
            <p class = "improve">Improvement 3 - Accessibility, Feedback, Constraints</p>
            <p>We added a mobile app that offers battery status, manual control
              mode, and GPS location. </p>
          </div>
          <div class = "rec-img" id = "three">
            <img src = "resources/images/appUI.png" alt = "app ui">
          </div>

        </div>

        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>This was my first product redesign experience with a team and it
            was satisfying. With our implementation of the wheels, the solar
            panels, and the app, users will obtain a safer user experience with
            more utilities. However, I saw our limitations. We redesigned based
            on purely theoretical perspectives, hence budgets, materials, and
            supporting techniques were not taken into consideration.
            I hope one day I will be able to build products from low-fidelity
            prototypes to high-fidelity prototypes, and eventually to an actual
            product being used.</p>
