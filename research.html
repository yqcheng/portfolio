          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Unlike the Western communication application marketplace which is saturated with
competitors, China shows a world with one clear winner, WeChat. Popular and well-integrated,
the application is a must have for visiting China. It has widely ranging
features from the normal like chat, stickers, and call/video to the innovative like scan QR code,
in-application payments, and built-in plug-in support. </p>

          <p>Yet, WeChat
seems to have had little success in becoming a staple social platform in the United States market
even with its inventive structure and abundant functionality. My team set off to seek for the answers</p>

        <!---Findings---->
        <div class = "text-section finding">
          <h2>Findings</h2>
          <p>Within these findings we discovered that the WeChat team for the most part has simply
translated WeChat's functionality from Chinese to English and other languages without
considering that some features are culturally specific and mainly useful to Chinese users. Our
research uncovered several interesting key findings that the WeChat team should look into:</p>
          <div class = "rec">
            <p class = "improve">Finding 1 </p>
            <p>Chinese users are still the main audience of WeChat, and distinctly a higher
percentage than Chinese Americans and non-Chinese Americans.</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "finding-img" id = "one">
            <img src = "resources/images/wc-finding1.jpg" alt = "finding1">
          </div>

          <div class = "rec">
            <p class = "improve">Finding 2  </p>
            <p>We originally expected Chinese Americans would use WeChat in a way that
resembled Chinese, at least with behavior or attitudes somewhere in-between
non-Chinese Americans and Chinese. However, we found that in some aspects they
use WeChat in an entirely independent fashion from both demographics.</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "finding-img" id = "two">
            <img src = "resources/images/wc-finding2.jpg" alt = "finding2">
          </div>

          <div class = "rec">
            <p class = "improve">Finding 3</p>
            <p>In the English version, people prefer culturally-appropriate terms for functional
features over literal translated terms. The more concise and descriptive, the better.
For example, "'Sticky on Top' is not as straighforward as 'Pin' term (interview, 2017)."</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "finding-img" id = "three">
            <img src = "resources/images/wc-finding3.jpg" alt = "finding3" >
          </div>

          <div class = "rec">
            <p class = "improve">Finding 4</p>
            <p>Additionally, some features are almost never used by all 3 ethnicity groups </p>
          </div>
          <div class = "finding-img" id = "four">
            <img src = "resources/images/wc-finding4.jpg" alt = "finding4" >
          </div>
        </div>

        <!---improvement---->
        <div class = "text-section">
          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <p>Our findings illustrated that non-Chinese Americans, Chinese Americans, and Chinese
have some difference as well as similarity in terms of preference on functionality. In order to
attract more users and aggrandize the popularity in the international market outside China, here
are some takeaways for WeChat designers and developers:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>WeChat should maintain its current features for Chineses users and create a different
set of culturally appropriate features for other ethnicity users. </li>
            <li>WeChat should consider the discrepancy between different ethnicity groups instead of
treating them as a whole.</li>
            <li>WeChat should conform in-application translations to culturally appropriate and
concise translations.</li>
            <li>WeChat should remove features that are rarely used by all users or re-orient their
functions in order to refine the app.</li>
          </ol>
